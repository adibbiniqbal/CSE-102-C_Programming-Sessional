# CSE 102: Structured Programming Language Sessional

**Course Code:** CSE 102  
**Course Title:** Structured Programming Language Sessional  
**Credit:** 1.50  
**Weekly Hours:** 3  
**Reference Language:** C

This repository contains lab assignments and problem-solving exercises completed as part of the **CSE 102 Sessional** course, which complements the theoretical course **CSE 101 (Structured Programming Language)**.

The sessional emphasizes practical implementation of structured programming concepts in C through hands-on lab exercises and a final project.

## üìò Topics Covered

The programs in this repository are based on the following key topics:

- **Data Types, Variables, Operators, Expressions**
- **Control Structures**: `if-else`, `switch`, `ternary`, loops (`while`, `do-while`, `for`), nested control flows, `break`, `continue`
- **Functions**: parameter passing, return types, recursion, variable argument functions
- **Arrays**: one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, matrix operations
- **Strings**: basic string operations, standard library functions
- **Pointers**: pointers to variables, strings, arrays, structures, and functions
- **User-defined Data Types**: `struct`, `union`, `enum`, `bitfield`
- **Bitwise Operations**
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
- **Input/Output**: console I/O, formatted I/O, file I/O
- **Command Line Arguments**
- **Preprocessor Directives and Header Files**
- **Error Handling**

## üß™ Lab Work

All lab assignments were completed using the C programming language. Each lab focuses on different fundamental aspects of structured programming. These labs reinforce concepts taught in the CSE 101 theory course by applying them to real-world coding problems.

## üñ•Ô∏è Final Project

The final project for the sessional, titled **"Digivas ‚Äì Digital Drawing Board"**, was built using the **iGraphics** C graphics library. It is hosted in a separate repository:

üîó **[View Final Project on GitHub](https://github.com/adibbiniqbal/iGraphics-Digital_Drawing_Board-Digivas)**

This interactive drawing board allows users to draw, fill colors, and manipulate shapes with a graphical interface developed entirely in C.

## üõ† Requirements

- GCC Compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- C Standard Library
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command-line execution
- For the final project: Windows (recommended), as iGraphics is platform-specific

## üìö Related Course

This sessional supports the theory course:

**CSE 101: Structured Programming Language**  
Covers the fundamentals of programming using C and is the foundation for all programming-related courses in the curriculum.
